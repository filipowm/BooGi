Create awesome documentation or tutorial pages following modern look-and-feel.
Customize it to your needs

## Motivation

Core intention is to provide a great template inspired by famous Gitbook.
The content would be written by developers (and not only!) 
and what better than writing it in Markdown! And since this needs to be 
user friendly documentation, we also needed rich embeds, syntax highlighting and more
customizations. End goal is to have a powerful and simple template
which could be used by anyone who needs to have 
documentation as code and beautiful site generated out of it.

To serve all these requirements, we decided to use Gatsby + MDX (Markdown + JSX) 
to extend markdown and used a neat consistent theme like the one at 
[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and deployed as docker containers.

It is a fork of https://github.com/hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter. Intention
is to improve Gitbook to provide more features, make look-and-feel more similar
to Gitbook, make it more configurable and easier to start.

## üîó Live Demo

Here's a [live demo](https://boogi.netlify.app).

## üöÄ Quickstart

Get started by running the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:filipowm/boogi.git
$ yarn
$ gatsby develop
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

## üîß Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

(TO BE UPDATED!!)

Open `config.js` for templating variables. Broadly configuration is available for `gatsby`, `header`, `sidebar` and `siteMetadata`.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration like 
    - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
    - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL
    - `gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics Tracking ID

- `header` config for site header configuration like
    - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
    - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
    - `links` - Links on the top right
    - `search` - Enable search and [configure Algolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/)

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration
    - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/<filename>"
    - `frontLine` - whether to show a front line at the beginning of a nested menu.(Collapsing capability would be turned of if this option is set to true)
    - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar
    - `ignoreIndex` - Set this to true if the index.md file shouldn't appear on the left sidebar navigation. Typically this can be used for landing pages.

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration
    - `title` - Title of the website
    - `description` - Description of the website
    - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
    - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

### Algolia Configuration

To setup Algolia, go to `config.js` and update the `search` object to look like the one below:

```json
    "search": {
		"enabled": true,
		"indexName": "MY_INDEX_NAME",
		"algoliaAppId": process.env.GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID,
		"algoliaSearchKey": process.env.GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY,
		"algoliaAdminKey": process.env.ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY
	},
```

Values for Algolia App ID, Search Key, and Admin Key can be obtained from Algolia Dashboard with the right set of permissions. Replace `MY_INDEX_NAME` with the Algolia Index name of your choice. To build the Algolia index, you need to run `npm run build` which will do a gatsby build along with content indexing in Algolia.

### Progressive Web App, Offline

To enable PWA, go to `config.js` and update the `pwa` object to look like the one below:

```json
   "pwa": {
        "enabled": false, // disabling this will also remove the existing service worker.
        "manifest": {
            "name": "Gatsby Gitbook Starter",
            "short_name": "GitbookStarter",
            "start_url": "/",
            "background_color": "#6b37bf",
            "theme_color": "#6b37bf",
            "display": "standalone",
            "crossOrigin": "use-credentials",
            icons: [
                {
                    src: "src/pwa-512.png",
                    sizes: `512x512`,
                    type: `image/png`,
                },
            ],
        },
    }
```

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing, add the `react-live=true` to the code section.
For example:

```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```

In the above code, just add `javascript react-live=true` after the triple quote ```
to start rendering react components that can be edited by users.

## ü§ñ SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits
Configure meta tags like title and description for each markdown
file using MDX Frontmatter.

```markdown

---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
description: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
