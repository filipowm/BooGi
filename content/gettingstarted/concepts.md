# Docs as Code

Docs as Code means applying software development processes and tools to
documentation you create. Teams write content in plain text with
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) using text editor. Then content is
transformed to documentation page using a static site generator rather than
a publishing system.

# Markdown

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the Internet easier.
The philosophy behind Markdown is that plain text documents should be readable without
tags mussing everything up, but there should still be ways to add text modifiers
like lists, bold, italics, etc. It is an alternative to _WYSIWYG_ (what you see is what
you get) editors, which use rich text that later gets converted to proper HTML.
