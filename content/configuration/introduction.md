BooGi gives you tons of customization and configuration options. You can not
only turn on/off and adjust nearly any feature available in BooGi, but
also adjust its color theme (or two if dark mode is enabled).

Before starting to configure your own BooGi page, we recommend going through 
basic information about [page structure](/gettingstarted/page_structure)
and [navigation](/configuration/navigation) details.

Then, start with [Setting Up](/configuration/setting-up) to configure your BooGi page
to match your desired features and metadata. After that you can apply your own
branding or tune theme to your needs. To do this follow 
[Themes / styling](/configuration/themes) guide.
