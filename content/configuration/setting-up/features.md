## Dark Mode theme

Dark mode theme feature allow **changing between light and dark
styling**. If set switch button appears in header.
To set up dark theme mode, configure following in `config.yml` (under `features` key).

```yaml
features:
  darkMode:
    enabled: true  # set to true to enable dark mode theme feature
    default: false # set to true to set dark mode as a default one
```

Additionally to changes in `config.yml` file, proper theme must be 
configured. To do this, follow description defined in [themes](/configuration/themes)
documentation.

## Edit on Repo

Edit on Repo features shows _Edit on Repo_ button on every page,
where it is configured. It gives all users easy way to start editing
your page.

To set up Edit on Repo, configure following in `config.yml` (under `features` key).

```yaml
features:
  editOnRepo:
    location: https://github.com/filipowm/boogi # URL to Git repository
    type: github # type of Git repository. Only github, gitlab and bitbucket are supported.
    editable: true # whether every page is editable by default. This can be configured per page setting up 'editable' property in frontmatter
```

As written above, even if Edit on Repo is globally turned off or on, it can be altered
per page by setting up `editable` property in [frontmatter](/editingcontent/page_config#frontmatter). This has precedence
over global configuration.

## Mermaid graphs

Mermaid brings generation of diagrams and flowcharts from text in a similar manner as markdown.
Details of usage are described in [Graphs](/editing/rich_content/graphs) section.

To set up Mermaid graphs, configure following in `config.yml` (under `features` key).

of automated propagation of some Netlify environment configuration,
such as page URL (especially useful for branch or pull request deployments)
and page location in code repository (e.g. Github).

**We recommend setting this as `true` **.

to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format.

      - Category 2

## Page metadata

BooGi can display page metadata (latest editor, last edit date) on every page below
the page title. To set it up globally configure following in `config.yml`:

```yaml
features:
  showMetadata: true
```

Even if page metadata is globally turned off or on, it can be altered
per page by setting up `showMetadata` property in [frontmatter](/editingcontent/page_config#frontmatter). 
This has precedence  over global configuration.

## Table of Contents

Table of Contents displays right sidebar with a useful
navigation between every section of the page. It also follows page scroll
and marks current section visible on the screen. New sections
are divided by using header (`#`) in page content.

To set up table of contents, configure following in `config.yml` (under `features` key).

```yaml
features:
  toc:
    show: true # set to true to show ToC on every page
    depth: 3 # depth of the ToC.
```

Even if table of contents is globally turned off or on, it can be altered
per page by setting up `showToc` property in [frontmatter](/editingcontent/page_config#frontmatter). 
Also on page you can alter depth of table of contents by setting up
`tocDepth` in frontmatter. Both settings have precedence over global configuration.
