# Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

# Code and syntax highlighting

```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Code blocks:
````
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.

# Tables

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

# Blockquotes

```
> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps.
  Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually
  wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

# Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```

# Horizontal rule

```
Three or more...

---
Hyphens

***
Asterisks

___
Underscores
```

# Footnotes

This is some text.[^1]. Other text.[^footnote].

[^1]: Some *crazy* footnote definition.

[^footnote]:
    > Blockquotes can be in a footnote.

        as well as code blocks

    or, naturally, simple paragraphs.

[^other-note]:       no code block here (spaces are stripped away)

[^codeblock-note]:
        this is now a code block (8 spaces indentation)

# Abbreviations

This is some text not written in HTML but in another language!

*[another language]: It's called Markdown
